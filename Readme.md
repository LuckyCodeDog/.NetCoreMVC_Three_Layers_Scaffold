- **Interfaceization of Layers**:
  - Abstract each layer into interfaces, defining expected behavior without concrete implementations.
- **Introduction of Projects**:
  - Create an interface project for defining layer interfaces.
  - Implement an IOC container project for managing dependencies.
- **Connection with IOC Container**:
  - Use the IOC container to link interfaces with their concrete implementations via dependency injection.
- **Inter-Layer Communication with IOC Container**:
  - Employ the IOC container to facilitate communication between layers, promoting loose coupling.
- **Data Transmission**:
  - Utilize entities for data transfer, enhancing system clarity and maintainability.
